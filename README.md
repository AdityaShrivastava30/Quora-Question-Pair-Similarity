# Quora Question Pair Similarity

## Description
This project aims to identify if two Quora questions are similar. Understanding question similarity can reduce redundancy and improve the user experience by grouping similar questions, making it easier to find the right answers.

## Installation
To set up this project, you will need to install certain Python libraries and dependencies. While specific installation commands are not detailed in the notebook, the following packages are essential:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- WordCloud

You can install these packages using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn nltk wordcloud
```

## Usage
The project utilizes several NLP features to assess similarity between question pairs, including token counts, stop word counts, common word counts, and more. Advanced NLP and fuzzy features are also explored to improve the model's performance.

The notebook outlines the process of feature extraction, data visualization, and model training using these features. To use this project:

1. Import your dataset in a similar format to the Quora question pairs.
2. Follow the steps for feature extraction as demonstrated.
3. Train the model using your choice of algorithm, as suggested in the notebook.

## Features
Key features of this project include:

- Basic feature extraction (e.g., word counts, common words).
- Advanced NLP feature extraction.
- Analysis and visualization of features.
- Model training and evaluation.

## Contributing
This project is open for contributions. If you have suggestions for improving the model or feature set, feel free to fork the project and submit a pull request. Please ensure your contributions adhere to project standards for code quality and documentation.
